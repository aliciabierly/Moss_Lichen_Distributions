# Moss Lichen Distributions Project Abstract

This project examines how environmental factors including aspect (north and south facing) and height from the ground (0 m and 0.5 m), influence the species richness and percent cover of moss and lichen on gravestones in Pioneer Cemetery (Eugene, Oregon). It was created for BIO 370 Ecology at the University of Oregon.
